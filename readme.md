# Summary

This is a very simple Windows app for randomly showing flashcards for study purposes.  It reads an Excel file out of the working directory and randomly shows questions and answers for you to use for study purposes.  Dirt simple, but very useful if you need to learn facts quickly.  I'll probably add file management, categories, and other features at some point.  Cheers, -Adrian
